I wrote this solution from scratch using my take-home interview template, I did not use their (super minimal) scaffolding.

The general gist of the original prompt was:

We get catered lunch.
Here's a text based menu for two weeks.
Make an app that renders the menu.

Yes, it was that generic. I used a hardcoded `suspend fun` with a delay to simulate a network call so that they could see I implemented a loading state.
